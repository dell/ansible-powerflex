# Ansible Modules for Dell Technologies PowerFlex

The Ansible Modules for Dell Technologies (Dell) PowerFlex allow Data Center and IT administrators to use RedHat Ansible to automate and orchestrate the provisioning and management of Dell PowerFlex storage systems.

The capabilities of the Ansible modules are managing SDCs, volumes, snapshots, snapshot policy, storage pools, replication consistency groups, replication pairs, SDSs, devices, protection domains, MDM cluster, Fault Set and to gather high level facts from the storage system. The options available are list, show, create, modify and delete. These tasks can be executed by running simple playbooks written in yaml syntax. The modules are written so that all the operations are idempotent, so making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request.

## Prerequisites

| **Ansible Modules** | **PowerFlex/VxFlex OS Version** | **SDK version** | **Python version** | **Ansible**              |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| v2.3.0 |3.6 <br> 4.0 <br> 4.5 | 1.10.0 | 3.9.x <br> 3.10.x <br> 3.11.x | 2.14 <br> 2.15 <br> 2.16 |

## Idempotency
The modules are written in such a way that all requests are idempotent and hence fault-tolerant. It essentially means that the result of a successfully performed request is independent of the number of times it is executed.
